/*
---------- TO DO LIST: ----------
1. Add Default COnstructor and Destructors to all Classes
2. Need to add those data validations you skipped
3. Need to add console read
4. Clean up that verification for tier, don't need to be that messy
5. Put in Honor Code Statement
6. Is "return out" correct?
7. Review PDF and Rubrick and Double Check everything works as intended
8. Data vlidation might be wrong, what if there is a space before next input?
9. Add line that singles what line the error was on
10. Only need to build a destructor in ClientList?  I think so
11. Make the bools for console silver and gold to make it clearer
12. Client viretual destrcutor issue, either write in all of them or do something idk
13. Go through code and clean up.  Need cin.clears?  Its the many inputs that were the problem...so clears not needed?
