3. Make Doxygen comments in code and include it in your zip submission



7. Remove pub;ic from class deriving statements, should it be protected instead?

9. Rewrite comments so that Relational Operators say "platintum to Platinum" or "Gold to Gold" correctly
10. Delete both parts of testing code later, aka the cout and the actual else if statement that makes things happen
11. Include ncomments explaining getPoints and getTier if stay included in Clinet and SilverClient


14.  Shoudl the sort be doing the opposite order? descending right so largest should come first?


- Review code and rubric/pdf to change any names to Project3 etc 




********************* Testing ***********************

1. Double check honor code statemnts fdr basic errors



******************* QUESTIONS FOR OH **************
1. Doxygn Documentation Complete?

2. Is my sorting algorithm correct? (descending order)

3. 



OH -----


Capital As when I convert all to lower case
